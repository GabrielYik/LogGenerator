== Introduction
The user guide is aimed towards users of `{appName}`.

== Process
There are several built in scenario files in the app, which are stored in the
`{scenarioDir}` folder. When the app starts up, a message appears and prompts you
to choose a scenario file. If the desired scenario is not represented by any of
the scenario files, a new one can be added to the `{scenarioDir}` folder.

[NOTE]
The scenario file has to be of a standard format, which can be found below.

Once the scenario file is chosen, `{appName}` will use the information specified
in the file to generate the set of sample logs. These logs will be put into a
CSV file in the `{logsDir}` folder.
