:appName: LogGenerator

== Introduction
This guide details the specification, development and implementation of `{appName}`.

== Motivation
A project required that security logs be created for examination purposes, namely to
test if an individual is able to shift through logs to spot security anomalies or
vulnerabilities.
The initial intention was to create these logs manually.
However, this approach is tedious and potentially error-prone.

As such, a decision was made to automate the generation of logs.
The benefits were clear: any number of logs can be generated easily, characteristics of
the logs generated can be specified, and changes made to specific logs can be propagated
consistently throughout if required.
The application developed to automate the generation of logs is aptly named `{appName}`.

== Basics

A log sheet is a set of logs that captures the actions of a scenario.
A log sheet has a set of headers with corresponding columns underneath.
Each column represents a specific attribute of a log.
A log has attributes such as its time and description.

A scenario consists of a series of actions acting on a software system.
Some of these actions constitute an exploit.

With the above definitions, a log sheet consists of two types of logs: exploit and
noise.
Exploit logs represent the actions in an exploit while noise logs represent everything
else.
Noise logs serve to hide the exploit logs, and also makes the scenario more realistic.

The attributes of the actions in a scenario are configurable through a configuration
file.
There are three types of attributes: global, group and local.

[cols="2, 5"]
.Attributes
|===
|Type |Description

|Global
|Applies to the log sheet and all logs in it.

|Group
|Applies to some logs.

|Local
|Applies to an individual log.
|===

This level of configuration allows the logs generated to model the scenario as close as
possible.

In the next two sections, we detail the attributes of a log, and the global, group and
local attributes of a scenario.

== Specifying Exploit Logs
An exploit does not show up in logs with a single definite pattern, and its
characteristics expressed depends on what the scenario designer.
As such, to provide scenario designers with the ability to specify as large a range of
different kinds of exploits through logs, all the attributes related to a scenario
are exposed through a configuration file.

There are however three attributes that would most likely be more useful in designing
more complex exploits: order, spacing and time period.
These attributes are present at the group level.

The order attribute allows an exploit to proceed linearly, and allows relationships
between exploit logs to be expressed more explicitly.
For example, given two logs, the first capturing a user login and the second capturing a
file request by that user, the placement of the first log before the second shows that
the occurrence of the first log leads to the occurrence of the second.
However, if a specific order is specified, the frequency attribute has to be ONCE since
an order imposed on logs cannot be fulfilled if the logs can occur any number of times.
Likewise, if the frequency attribute does not have the value of ONCE, the order
attribute cannot be specified for the aforementioned reason.

The spacing attribute allows an exploit to appear more precisely executed by suggesting
that some thought was given by the exploit perpetrator as to when consecutive actions
should be done.
For example, given two logs, both capturing failed user logins, the occurrence of first
log a number of logs away from the second log suggests that the perpetrator could be
trying to avoid arousing suspicion.
However, if a specified spacing is specified, the frequency attribute has to be ONCE
since spacing imposed between two logs is only defined on logs occurring only once, and
the order attribute has to be specified since spacing is imposed between two logs in
that particular order.
If frequency other than ONCE is specified and order is not specified, spacing cannot be
specified for the aforementioned reason.

The time period attribute allows an exploit to appear more preciously executed by
suggesting that some thought was given by the exploit perpetrator as to when actions
should take place. For example, given a set of logs, all capturing failed user logins,
the occurrence of this set of logs after midnight suggests that the perpetrator could be
attempting to brute force a secure system.

Logs that have their order, spacing and time period attributes specified are referred to
as fixed logs.
This is because these logs have relationships defined on them and others, which results
in them being placed in specific areas in the log sheet.

On the other hand, logs that do not have their order, spacing and time period attributes
specified are referred to as fluid logs.
This is because these logs can be placed anywhere in the log sheet.

[NOTE]
Fixed logs are not exploit logs.
Fluid logs are not noise logs.
A log being fixed or fluid is a physical quality, while a log being exploit or noise is
based on the intention of the scenario designer.

== Characteristics of a Good Log Sheet
* Follows the scenario configuration file as closely as possible
* Random generated noise logs
* Given different instances of the same scenario configuration file and exploit logs
with no time constraints, the instances have different placement of exploit logs
* There must be some number of noise logs before the first exploit log, and some number
of noise logs after the last exploit log. This is to make it more difficult for the
exploit logs to be spotted

== Approach
Among all the scenario attributes, only the time period group attribute is difficult to
implement. As such, the ease of implementation of this attribute must be considered in
deciding the best approach to development.

Since there are two types of logs: exploit and noise, development could be done in three
approaches:

. Exploit then noise
. Noise then exploit
. Exploit and noise together

To decide between these three approaches, three criterions are considered:

* Complexity of implementation
* Cohesiveness
* Adherence to scenario

=== Exploit then Noise

==== Overview
Exploit logs are generated before exploit logs.

==== Implementation
Exploit logs are generated first. There are three constraints on exploit logs to
consider: order, spacing and time.

Order is the simplest to resolve. If there is only a single group, the logs are ordered
as specified. If there is more than one group, the ordering between two logs from two
different groups is not specified and hence can be in any order. If there are no groups,
no ordering is needed.

Spacing is resolved by putting placeholders between the logs. These placeholders would
contain details about how many logs are needed between the two logs.

Time is not entirely straightforward to resolve. If there are specific time constraints
on the group like 1AM to 5AM, these are applied to the time values of the logs. Then,
we insert placeholders before the first and after the last exploit log. These
placeholders detail how many logs are needed in those areas.

Now it's time to generate the noise logs. Currently, we have our exploit logs with their
constraints resolved, and with placeholders between and around them as required. The
generation of the noise logs need only follow the details of the placeholders. For the
first placeholder (before the first exploit log), the time values of the noise logs have
to be generated backwards to ensure that the timings are consistent.

|Cohesiveness

|Adherence to scenario

=== Noise then Exploit

==== Overview
Noise logs are generated before exploit logs.

==== Implementation
However, the
time values of the noise logs cannot be generated before injection of exploit logs since
the injection of exploit logs would require changes in the time values of surrounding
noise logs to maintain realistic time values throughout. Furthermore, if exploit logs
are constrained by a time constraint, the noise logs would most likely require a rework
of their time values.

Instead, we could generate the noise logs without time values, then inject the exploit
logs with time values, then set the time values of the noise logs from there. If say
the first exploit log has a time value of 1am, then the previous noise log would be
around 5pm (assuming 5pm is the end time for all logs). If the first exploit log has a
time value of 2pm (within the start and end time for all logs), the previous noise log
would be an amount of time before that.

We could also generate noise logs to fill the entire log sheet, with time values, and
replace individual noise logs where required with exploit logs. However, this might lead
to a situation with more logs than is specified since some exploit logs may have time
constraints that specify that their time values should be outside of the time set
globally.

==== Evaluation

|Criterion |Evaluation

|Complexity of implementation
|Flow of control almost linear from fixed logs to fluid to fixed

|Cohesiveness
|Some criss-crossing of control

|Adherence to scenario
|Might not when injecting fixed logs into the log sheet
|===

=== Noise and Exploit

==== Overview
Noise and exploit logs are generated together.

==== Implementation
Some noise logs will be generated
first, but when it comes to a time when exploit logs have to be generated, noise log
generation will stop and transfer control to exploit log generation.

This requires checks for every log generation and is inefficient.
